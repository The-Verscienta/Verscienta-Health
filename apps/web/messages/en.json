      "q1": {
        "question": "What is Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)?",
        "answer": "Traditional Chinese Medicine is a comprehensive medical system that has been practiced for thousands of years. It includes various practices such as acupuncture, herbal medicine, massage (Tui Na), exercise (Qi Gong), and dietary therapy. TCM views the body as an interconnected system and focuses on restoring balance and harmony to promote health."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "Are Chinese herbs safe?",
        "answer": "When used appropriately and under the guidance of a qualified practitioner, Chinese herbs are generally safe. However, like any medicine, they can have side effects and may interact with pharmaceutical medications. Always consult with a licensed healthcare provider before starting any herbal regimen, especially if you are pregnant, nursing, or taking other medications."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "How are TCM formulas different from single herbs?",
        "answer": "TCM formulas are carefully crafted combinations of multiple herbs working synergistically. Each herb in a formula has a specific role: some are primary herbs that address the main concern, while others support, enhance, or moderate the effects. This balanced approach is a hallmark of traditional Chinese herbal medicine and often provides more comprehensive and gentler effects than using single herbs alone."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "Can I combine TCM with conventional Western medicine?",
        "answer": "Many people successfully integrate TCM with conventional medicine. However, it's crucial to inform all your healthcare providers about any herbs, supplements, or treatments you're using to avoid potential interactions. A qualified TCM practitioner can work with your medical doctor to create a safe, complementary treatment plan."

      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "What should I expect in my first TCM consultation?",
        "answer": "Your first consultation typically includes a comprehensive health history, tongue and pulse diagnosis, and discussion of your current concerns. The practitioner will assess your overall constitution and create a personalized treatment plan, which may include herbal formulas, acupuncture, dietary recommendations, or lifestyle modifications. Most initial consultations last 60-90 minutes."
