## 🏥 HIPAA Compliance Assessment

### Understanding HIPAA Scope

**Important Note**: HIPAA compliance is only required if the application:

1. Is a Covered Entity (healthcare provider, health plan, healthcare clearinghouse)
2. Is a Business Associate (handles PHI on behalf of covered entities)
3. Stores, processes, or transmits Protected Health Information (PHI)

**PHI Includes**:

- Name + health information
- Medical record numbers
- Health plan numbers
- Account numbers
- Biometric identifiers
- Photos (if related to health)
- Any unique identifying information + health data

**Verscienta Health Considerations**:

- ✅ General health information (herbs, formulas) - NOT PHI
- ⚠️ Symptom checker inputs - COULD BE PHI if identifiable
- ⚠️ User health reviews - COULD BE PHI if detailed
- ❌ Practitioner profiles - NOT PHI (public information)

**Recommendation**: Treat symptom checker data as PHI and implement full HIPAA controls.

### HIPAA Technical Safeguards

#### 1. Access Control (§164.312(a)(1)) ✅

**Required**:

- ✅ Unique user identification
- ✅ Emergency access procedure (admin override)
- ⚠️ Automatic logoff (must implement 15-min timeout)
- ⚠️ Encryption and decryption (must encrypt PHI at rest)

**Implementation Status**:

```typescript
// ✅ Implemented
- Unique user IDs via better-auth
- Role-based access control
- Session management (24-hour general sessions)
- Idle timeout hook (15 minutes for PHI pages)
- Session timeout warnings

// ⚠️ Needs Enhancement
- PHI field encryption (database column level)
- Apply idle timeout hook to symptom checker UI
```

#### 2. Audit Controls (§164.312(b)) ✅

**Required**: Hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms that record and examine activity in systems containing PHI.

**Current Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

**Completed**:

- ✅ Audit logging system tracking:
  - Who accessed PHI (user ID, email, role, session ID)
  - What PHI was accessed (resource type, resource ID, action)
  - When access occurred (timestamp with timezone)
  - What actions were taken (view, create, update, delete, export)
  - Where access originated (IP address, user agent, location)
- ✅ Immutable audit logs (write-once Payload collection)
- ✅ Log retention for 6+ years (configured)
- ✅ Query functions for compliance reports
- ⏳ Regular audit log reviews (process to be established)

#### 3. Integrity (§164.312(c)(1)) ✅
